        <p>I am reluctant to count the days since his death. Today I did. 53. Fifty-three days since we said goodbye forever. That morning I took a little sponge and dipped it in coffee and touched it to his lips. Coffee and Bible devotion in the mornings was our custom. In my confusion I read the devotional for the day <em>after</em> his death. God in His kindness ordained it so: Isaiah 46:4 I will be your God throughout your lifetime–until your hair is white with age. I made you, and I will care for you. That afternoon my husband was in the presence of the Author.</p>

<p>They tell me the hurt never goes away. It can be triggered by something so simple like the smell of his windbreaker, the sight of his watch and wedding ring on his nightstand, a melody we cherished. Sometimes the longing [read sobbing] comes at the most inopportune time: like driving in traffic. Pull over safely. “Lord, this hurts. Please take me through this.” And He does, for the moment. As humans we are destined to endure such hurts and more. But God–my favorite words in Scripture–is my Strong Tower. I will be your God throughout your lifetime…</p>
