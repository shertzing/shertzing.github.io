      <description>&lt;p&gt;Those who traveled with me noticed I carried a small voice recorder. My hope was to upload Shafiq&amp;rsquo;s commentary in Israel and join it with photos from our group. I&amp;rsquo;m learning audio/video techniques right now and my &lt;i&gt; practice&lt;/i&gt; video is my granddaughter, Nicole. More later!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning Curve</title>

People ask me what I loved most about Israel. This photo just about sums my trip and my life in 2016. God, being my Helper, showed up in the form of His beloved people who stepped forward and helped me to the next level of recovery after the loss of my dear husband. His hands, His love, His provision&amp;hellip;all supplied by those who love God in such a magnificent way that they think nothing of putting their lives aside to help others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arthritic knees, spontaneous leg cramping, and an injured big right toe were my handicaps on this Israel trip. Yet my fellow pilgrims continued to take me by the arm and guide me up the inclines and the steps of the Holy Land. If angels have human forms, well, they look like the ladies on this trip, they look like my CBS and church family, my own dear family; they look like strangers who step up and do kind and tender things and then disappear into a crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at the beginning of 2017, my heart is overwhelmed with gratitude for those who ministered to me while I learned the ropes of being a widow. A title I never sought, but hope to bring dignity to the memory of my dear husband and honor to my God Who consoled, comforted, guided, protected me while I learn the role of widowhood.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Widow&#39;s Chronicle Day 53</title>
      <link>http://sonjahertzing.com/post/widows_chronicle_day_53/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am reluctant to count the days since his death. Today I did. 53. Fifty-three days since we said goodbye forever. That morning I took a little sponge and dipped it in coffee and touched it to his lips. Coffee and Bible devotion in the mornings was our custom. In my confusion I read the devotional for the day &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; his death. God in His kindness ordained it so: Isaiah 46:4 I will be your God throughout your lifetime–until your hair is white with age. I made you, and I will care for you. That afternoon my husband was in the presence of the Author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They tell me the hurt never goes away. It can be triggered by something so simple like the smell of his windbreaker, the sight of his watch and wedding ring on his nightstand, a melody we cherished. Sometimes the longing [read sobbing] comes at the most inopportune time: like driving in traffic. Pull over safely. “Lord, this hurts. Please take me through this.” And He does, for the moment. As humans we are destined to endure such hurts and more. But God–my favorite words in Scripture–is my Strong Tower. I will be your God throughout your lifetime…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Widow Training</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;He’s gone. It’s not that I didn’t know that he was dying, I just never wanted to accept the reality that I would be without my husband. Reality or not, he died and I am left to deal with countless emotions, situations, and decisions that demand my sole attention, for now I have no spouse to take up the slack of our everyday life. So how does a girl go about learning to be a widow? Learn-as-you-go-training, is it? A position uniquely tailored in that the husband must die in order for you to acquire the title. My heart wants to shout, Not fair!! but my head acknowledges that by all accounts we were dealt a fair amount of time together and most of it was good and wonderful and…ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Were it not for my faith in God and His loving kindness to me, the loss of my husband would be unbearable. I am comforted as always by Scripture delivered characteristically at just the right time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 54:5 For thy Maker is thine Husband; the Lord of Hosts is His name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; the God of the whole earth shall He be called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God steps in. His care for me is on display. I submit to Him to teach me this widow role that’s been dealt to me.&lt;/p&gt;
